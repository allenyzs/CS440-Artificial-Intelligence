## Project description
### 1. Logistic Regression 2. Neural Networks 3. Digit Classification
We are designing and implementing a simple neural network and train it on 3 different datasets. Our goals: 
1. Understand how neural networks work. 
2. Implement a logistic regression classifier, and a neural network classifier. 
3. Understand the role of different parameters of a neural network, such as learning rate.
4. Learn how to evaluate a classifier using metrics like classification accuracy and confusion matrices.
